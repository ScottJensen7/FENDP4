# Project 4 Classic Arcade Game
##### by Scott Jensen, March 10, 2016

In this game we have a Player and Enemies. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player starts at the bottom middle of the scene on the grassy patch, and can move left, right, up and down, using the arrow keys. The enemies move in randomally varying speeds from left to right on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

##### Additional Functionality

In addition to the basic functionality, more cool functionality has been added to the game. Here are the features I have added:

1. Collectibles: three orange gems were added to the game, at the top of the scene in the water. The player has to collect them and then the gem shrinks and the player brings it to the grassy patch.

2. Player selection: allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game: char-cat-girl.png, char-princess-girl.png, and char-boy.png.

3. Winning gold star: when all the gems are dropped off on the grass and the player goes to the water, the big gold star shows up and it says, "Congratulations! You won! Press any arrow key to play again."

## Miscellaneous  

The courses and discussion groups are always helpful with projects. I got help with basics of making objects passing in parameters:

I have this problem. My project was unable to be reviewed this morning. I wanted to turn it in before the deadline for "exceeds specifications." But now I can't resubmit because there was no resubmission button anywhere! I sent an email asking for help. My questions are, how do I submit this before the deadline? If I can't make it in time, will I get "exceeds specifications?"
